Notes
------------

Front end is successfully sending requests to back-end
Back end is hashing, abridging and returning url
Url validation should happen on next endpoint not the python endpoint

Next features:
- Regex url validation
- Temporary error message for invalid urls
- Loading spinner on url card
- Back-end should gracefully handle not found
- Enhance home page to have cards for each demo
- Optimize text field so that the state update is interruptable
- Memoize separate demos using memo and lazy
- Implement Alembic to manage db migrations
